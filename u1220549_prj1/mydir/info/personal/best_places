I'm from Jerusalem,so I definitely visited Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Old City,praying in it gives you an indescribable feeling .Thank God for this opportunity ,which all Palestinians will have in the future ,IIn sha'allah ,also I visited The Church of the Holy Sepulchre when I was young,so I don't remember it much.
I went to Jericho with my schools to amusement parks and of course Hisham's Palace.
I went on a trip with my school to Super Land in Jaffa,we visited the Auja River.Unfortunately,the water was so dirty that it was almost black.
During the period of the end of the home stone,my family and I visited the suspension bridges in Haifa,which was little scary but beautiful experience,and also Acre,whose walls or even it's old town I will never forget,which will remain in my memory.The scary experience that day was the fast ship in Acre,It was very fast that we thought we going to fall into the sea,but thankfully nothing happened .When we returned home,we discovered that some people had fallen from it,and fortunately nothing happened to them.
I visited the city of Bethlehem a lot because of my mother's aunt there.She's her only relative in Palestine.It's a beautiful city,especially Al-Mahdar Squre(Mangers Squre).
A funny thing is that I had never visited the city of Ramallah in my life until I started studying at Birzeit University.
